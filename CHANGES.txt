Change Log
--------


## v1.2 (9/07/2024)

NEW

- tmatrix_hdf5 utility to export T-matrices in a standard HDF5 format

IMPROVEMENTS

- exportTmatrix gains two output parameters, q and qp, to facilitate indexing of T-matrix elements


## v1.1.3 (27/01/2020)


BUG FIX

- The utility function `epsSi` wrongly returned the complex refractive index of silicon rather than its dielectric function. [reported by Konstantin Ladutenko]


## v1.1.2 (20/10/2016)

NEW

- A utility function `sparseTmatrix` converts a T-matrix calculated by SMARTIES (stored as multiple cell arrays for each positive m value) into a fully-expanded T-matrix in sparse format, with all mâ€™s (including negative values). This matrix layout, although less efficient in terms of storage, is compatible with the Optical Tweezer Toolbox of Nieminen and co-workers.

BUG FIX

- The utility function `exportTmatrix` was producing incorrect output (the n,k indices were wrong).

## v1.1.1 (13/09/2016)

BUG FIX

- There was an error in line  46 of rvhGetFullMatrix.m`, as a result only half of the full matrix was returned (the rest was zeros). Thanks to Dominik Theobald for spotting the problem!

## v1.1 (5/01/2016)

Initial release after referee reports.


## v1.0 (3/11/2015)

First release for submission to JQSRT.
