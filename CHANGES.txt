## v1.1.3 (27/01/2020)


BUG FIX

- The utility function `epsSi` wrongly returned the complex refractive index of silicon rather than its dielectric function. [reported by Konstantin Ladutenko]


## v1.1.2 (20/10/2016)

NEW

- A utility function `sparseTmatrix` converts a T-matrix calculated by SMARTIES (stored as multiple cell arrays for each positive m value) into a fully-expanded T-matrix in sparse format, with all m’s (including negative values). This matrix layout, although less efficient in terms of storage, is compatible with the Optical Tweezer Toolbox of Nieminen and co-workers.

BUG FIX

- The utility function `exportTmatrix` was producing incorrect output (the n,k indices were wrong).

## v1.1.1 (13/09/2016)

BUG FIX

- There was an error in line  46 of rvhGetFullMatrix.m`, as a result only half of the full matrix was returned (the rest was zeros). Thanks to Dominik Theobald for spotting the problem!

## v1.1 (5/01/2016)

Initial release after referee reports.


## v1.0 (3/11/2015)

First release for submission to JQSRT.
