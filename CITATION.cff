  SMARTIES (Spheroids Modelled Accurately with a Robust
  T-matrix Implementation for Electromagnetic Scattering) is
  a suite of Matlab codes for the calculation of the optical
  properties of oblate and prolate spheroidal particles,
  with comparable capabilities and ease-of-use as Mie theory
  for spheres.
